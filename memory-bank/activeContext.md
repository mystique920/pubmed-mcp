## Current Focus

*   [2025-04-08 09:28:49] - Debugging MCP tool execution logic in `src/index.ts`. Tools (`search`, `getLatestArticles`) are exposed correctly after schema fix, but reportedly return no results when called. Investigating `search` and `fetchArticleDetails` functions.

## Recent Changes

*   [2025-04-08 09:19:35] - Applied fix to `src/index.ts` by replacing Zod schemas with JSON Schema literals in the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler. User confirmed build success and correct tool exposure, but reported tools now return no results.
*   [2025-04-08 09:15:57] - Analyzed `src/index.ts` and confirmed the likely cause of the schema error: using Zod schema objects directly in the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler instead of standard JSON Schema object literals for `inputSchema`.
*   [2025-04-08 09:15:51] - Updated `productContext.md` with the refined project goal (debugging MCP schema).
*   [2025-04-08 09:12:01] - Initialized Memory Bank files.
