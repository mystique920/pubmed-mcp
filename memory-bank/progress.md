## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-08 09:19:35] - Fixed MCP tool schema definition in `src/index.ts` by using JSON Schema literals.

## Current Tasks

*   [2025-04-08 09:29:12] - Debug MCP tool execution logic (`search`, `fetchArticleDetails` functions in `src/index.ts`) as tools are reportedly returning no results despite successful calls.

## Next Steps

*   Analyze `search` and `fetchArticleDetails` functions for potential errors in API calls, response handling, or data processing.
*   Add logging or propose fixes based on analysis.
*   Request user to build and test again.
